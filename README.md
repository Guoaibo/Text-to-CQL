# Text-to-CQL
This is the entire dataset of our CIKM 2022 paper "SpCQL: A Semantic Parsing Dataset for Converting Natural Language into Cypher", including the train, validation, and test sets.

Since the size of the neo4j database exceeded the github upload limit requirements, we have to upload it to Baidu.com. The neo4j database used for the dataset can be downloaded via Baidu.com. Of course, the entire version of the data is also available for download on Baidu.com along with it.
